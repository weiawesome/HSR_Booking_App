>Why we choose React-Native and Expo

 * why is the React-Native
    * Because using React-Native is a good choice for developing a dual platform app in a short time.

    * You just only need to know a few knowledge about css event without javascript then you can make it.

 * Then why is the Expo
 
    * I use a ASUS laptop to develope it. Hence, by Expo I can easily use my Iphone to solve it without a emulator.

>The step we do

1. Drawing the UI in Figma
2. Confirm the position, layout and animation in every page
3. Search anything we may need
