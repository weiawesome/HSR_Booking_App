# HSR_Booking_App

Hello this is our term-project for DB class.

We use the "React-Native" to make the UI format(front-end), and now I use "Pyhon" as back-end.

(Later we will use "Java" for back-end.

>Why we choose React-Native and Expo

 * why is the React-Native
 
Because using React-Native is a good choice for developing a dual platform app in a short time.

You just only need to know a few knowledge about css event without javascript then you can make it.

 * Then why is the Expo
 
I use a ASUS laptop to develope it. Hence, by Expo I can easily use my Iphone to solve it without a emulator.

>How to make it

1. Download the "Node.js"
2. Use npm install expo
3. Use expo init the Project
4. Read the document to realize it!!!
