>Briefly introduce
>>Hello this is our term-project for DB class.
>>
>>We use the "React-Native" to make the UI format(front-end), and now I use "Pyhon" and "Java" as back-end.

>Why we choose React-Native and Expo

 * why is the React-Native
    * Because using React-Native is a good choice for developing a dual platform app in a short time.

    * You just only need to know a few knowledge about css event without javascript then you can make it.

 * Then why is the Expo
 
    * I use a ASUS laptop to develope it. Hence, by Expo I can easily use my Iphone to solve it without a emulator.
    * Use the app "Expo Go" download by Google play or App store
